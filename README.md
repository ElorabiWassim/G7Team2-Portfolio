### Team Retrospective Analysis

Throughout the development process, our team encountered several technical and collaborative challenges that tested our ability to adapt and cooperate effectively. The most significant technical challenge we faced was deploying our React based web application to GitHub Pages. Since the project depended heavily on Node modules, we encountered numerous deployment errors, including ENAMETOOLONG, 404 errors during publishing, and issues where HTML and CSS were displayed but JSX components failed to render. We explored multiple solutions, such as editing the configuration files (vite.js , package.json) and adjusting the deployment paths. However, these approaches did not fully resolve the issue. Ultimately, we decided to rebuild the project using basic HTML and CSS, which allowed for a smoother deployment process and ensured full compatibility with GitHub Pages. This decision required significant rework but demonstrated the teamâ€™s adaptability and problem solving skills under pressure.

Another key challenge involved managing merge conflicts during collaboration. These conflicts often occurred when multiple team members made edits to the same files on different branches. To resolve them, we manually compared the conflicting versions line by line, identifying the correct and updated changes to integrate. This process, while time consuming, helped us better understand Gitâ€™s version control mechanisms and improved our communication regarding task assignments.

The pull request and peer review workflow proved to be highly effective in maintaining code quality and consistency across the project. By regularly pulling before starting new work, we minimized the likelihood of major conflicts and ensured our local copies were always up to date. Frequent commits, even for small changes, helped us test and track progress continuously. The structured pull and push mechanisms facilitated smoother collaboration, and the peer review process encouraged accountability and shared ownership of the final software artifact, ultimately leading to a more stable and cohesive project outcome.
